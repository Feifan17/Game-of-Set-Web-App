## The Game of Set, Reloaded


***

## Overview
In this project, the Code Fellas team redesigned the [Game of Set](https://github.com/cse3901-2019au-1020/proj2-code) using Javascript. The project runs on a single webpage.

## Additional Features
* Graphical User Interface
* Hint Generator
* Sound Effect
* Timer

## Instructions

### To Run the Game:
1. Clone the git repository into local machine.

2. Open file 'index.html' with any web browser.

### To Play the Game:
* Click on a card to add it to your selection. After you select three cards, the game will tell you whether they are a set. Re-click the card to unselect.

* After you successfully identify a set, the three cards in your selection will be removed, and the game will automatically add three new cards shuffled from the deck. Your score and number of cards remaining will be updated, and are kept on the right.

* The game ends when there is no card left in the deck, and no existing set on board. When you identify such situation, click "HINT" button to end the game.

* Clicking on the "RESTAET" button will discard the game progress so far and restart the game. The timer will also be reset.

* Clicking on the "HINT" button will give a clue of possible set of cards. If there is no existing set on board, all cards will be put back to the deck and shuffle.

* Clicking on the "HELP" button to check the rules of the game.
